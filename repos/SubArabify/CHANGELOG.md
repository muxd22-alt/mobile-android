# Changelog

## 3.0.2-beta — AI removed: subtitle-only pipeline

All Puter.js AI is gone (translation + audio transcription), and the API token
config with it — the account was rate-limited and is no longer useful.

- **Removed:** `translateSRTWithPuter`, `transcribeAudioWithPuter`, the Puter
  init/auth block, `PUTER_AUTH_TOKEN` handling, the `@heyputer/puter.js`
  dependency, and the XHR-shim polyfill. Nothing calls any AI service now.
- **Pipeline** is now: existing output → skip · local Arabic → brand ·
  OpenSubtitles Arabic (hash→title) → brand · English found → `skip-english` ·
  nothing → `no-subtitle`. Videos without a ready-made Arabic subtitle are left
  untouched with the reason recorded in `logs/decisions.jsonl`.
- **Branding** updated (as requested): watermark is now
  `[ ترجمت الأداة ساب أرابيفاي ]` (the "— مدعوم من Puter.js" clause is gone),
  and the website (`docs/index.html`) no longer claims AI features.
- `identifyMovie` strips both `\` and `/` separators so Windows-style paths
  parse correctly on Linux (caught by CI).
- package renamed `subarabify-puter` → `subarabify`; app `versionCode` 27,
  `versionName "3.0.2-beta"`.
- Tests updated to the no-AI behavior (English/no-subtitle paths assert clean
  skips).

## 3.0.1-beta — subtitle-first pipeline, stage 1: identify + fetch

First slice of the genre-aware rebuild: stop reaching for the microphone when a
subtitle already exists. AI transcription is now the last resort, not the default.

- **`movie-identifier.js`** — release name → `{title, year, season/episode}` via
  `parse-torrent-title` (MIT, pure JS) with a cleaned/fuzzy fallback when the parser
  finds nothing; noise-only names (`___1080p___`) are rejected instead of invented.
- **`opensubtitles.js`** — plain REST client for OpenSubtitles.com v1 (no SDK):
  `GET /subtitles` search (moviehash → title+year), the two-step `POST /download` link
  flow, optional `/login` JWT when account credentials are configured, 429/5xx retries,
  quota-exhaustion detection, and a dependency-free **OSHash** implementation verified
  against the canonical `opensubtitles/oshash` test vectors.
- **`subtitle-finder.js`** — the priority ladder: local Arabic → OpenSubtitles Arabic →
  local English → OpenSubtitles English → nothing. Arabic is classified by *content*, not
  just file name; its own output/cache files are never re-consumed; every candidate is
  validated (SRT parse, cue-count-vs-runtime sanity, UTF-8 normalization incl. BOM/UTF-16)
  before it is accepted. Exposes a provider hook for the later `subliminal_patch` layer.
- **`srt-utils.js`** — shared parse/validate/build/normalize helpers; the historic
  watermark cue and `MovieName.SubArabify.ar.srt` naming are unchanged.
- **`decision-log.js` + `config.js`** — every per-movie decision appended as JSONL to
  `logs/decisions.jsonl` (no native SQLite — it is fragile to build on Termux/ARM64), and
  a dependency-free `.env` loader for `OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY` / `TMDB_API_KEY`.
- **Watch loop** — `processVideoFile` now routes: existing output → skip · Arabic →
  brand only · English → Puter translation · none → audio transcription, with injectable
  hooks so tests never touch the network.
- **Tests** — 63 cases (`npm test`): identifier across genres (sci-fi, horror, TV,
  Arabic filenames), OSHash canonical vectors + zero-padding, SRT validation/encoding,
  finder ordering with mocked providers, and full pipeline routing.
- **CI** — new `Node Tests` workflow runs the suite with the `OpenSubtitles`/`TMDBAPI`
  repository secrets; live contract tests skip cleanly when the keys are absent.
- App: `versionCode` 26, `versionName "3.0.1-beta"` (label + banner bumped).
- Docs: README documents the fallback order, `.env` keys, and a manual test plan.

## 0.2.3-alpha — same engine, versioned

First cut re-releasing the clean-slate stack under a new version line. Everything from
0.2.2-beta carries over; this tag's job is to lock the **Jellyfin addon** addition that
0.2.2-beta CI shipped days after its tag.

- App: `versionCode` 23, `versionName "0.2.3-alpha"` (label, User-Agent, multipart
  boundary, brand line all bumped).
- **Jellyfin addon now in the release**: `jellyfin-addon/` is a backend-driven companion
  of the Colab backend — scan a library on a server or in Termux, route each movie
  (skip / translate / transcribe), write branded `*.SubArabify.ar.srt`. One URL
  everywhere; `--qrcode` prints a scannable QR on the TV; `--serve` exposes
  `http://<host>:8477/subarabify/config`; `run-termux.sh` is the universal runner.
- CI builds, self-tests the addon, and publishes `SubArabify-0.2.3-alpha.apk` + the
  addon ZIP + `jellyfin-manifest.json` to GitHub Pages.
- Docs & landing page updated to v0.2.3-alpha with the unified one-URL story.

## 0.2.2-beta — clean slate, one backend

A reset that takes the lesson of the earlier betas: the phone should only carry the
routing, not the models. Every translation and transcription now runs on a free Google
Colab T4 backend, and the repo history was squashed to a single commit that tells only
this story.

**One hidden engine — [`backend/SubArabify_Backend.ipynb`](backend/SubArabify_Backend.ipynb)**
- Colab T4 → installs Hugging Face `transformers` + FastAPI, loads
  `samil24/whisper-large-arabic-dialects-v5` (Whisper large-v3 fine-tune for Arabic
  dialects, fp16) and `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ar`, then bootstraps with a free
  Cloudflare quick tunnel (no account; pyngrok fallback).
- Async job API: `POST /jobs` (`srt=` translate · `file=` transcribe) → `GET /jobs/{id}`
  progress → `GET /jobs/{id}/srt`. 5-min overlapping windows, midpoint-stitched.
- Always returns **plain, unbranded SRT** — the client brands it with the same rules everywhere.

**Python client — [`client/`](client/)**
- Same routing as Android: existing `.SubArabify.ar.srt` → skip; English `.srt` →
  translate; none → ffmpeg-extract 16 kHz WAV → transcribe.
- `--media` (repeatable) recursive scans, `--sync` blocking mode, `--transport auto|wav|opus`
  (Opus keeps big movies under the tunnel's ~100 MB body cap), `--job <id>` resume,
  `--timeout` deadline (default 90 min).
- 19 CI-run tests (12 client + 7 srtcore) against a mock backend — no ffmpeg needed.

**Android — thin container**
- `BackendClient.kt`: `/health` probe (model + MT status), multipart uploads, tolerant
  polling (`MAX_POLL_MISSES=12`), 6 h deadline.
- Worker routes: existing Arabic → done; smart source resolver finds `.en.srt` →
  translate; else `AudioExtractor` streams a 16 kHz mono WAV (MediaCodec, no FFmpeg) →
  transcribe. Returns are branded via `SrtParser.buildBrandedSrt` and written as
  `*.SubArabify.ar.srt` with in-app preview.
- Backend card in the UI to paste the tunnel URL (health-rendered `online`/`offline`).
- **Removed**: ML Kit translator, Vosk speech-to-text, translation memory, all their deps.
  `versionCode` 22, `versionName 0.2.2-beta`; `usesCleartextTraffic` enabled for tunnel URLs.

**Docs & housekeeping**
- Landing page, README, and CI rebuilt around the one-engine story. CI self-tests the
  Python client + the Jellyfin addon and ships `SubArabify-0.2.2-beta.apk`.

**Jellyfin addon — unified, backend-driven ([`jellyfin-addon/`](jellyfin-addon/))**
- Re-added the "smart way": the addon is now a **third front door for the same Colab
  backend** (the old on-device whisper.cpp/llama.cpp engine is gone). Runs on a Jellyfin
  server or in Termux (phone / Android TV); identical routing + branding
  (`srtcore.py` is a byte-identical copy of `client/srtcore.py`).
- **One URL everywhere**: `--url` > `$SUBARABIFY_COLAB_URL` > `config.json` `colab_url` —
  exactly the URL pasted into the app's Backend card.
- **QR on the TV for the Android app**: `python jellyfin-addon/subarabify_jellyfin.py
  --qrcode` prints a scannable QR of the backend URL (scan → paste into the app) plus an
  optional `--qr-png`; `--serve` exposes a LAN endpoint
  (`http://<host>:8477/subarabify/config`) for phone-safe copying.
- **Smart transport on the server**: files ≤ ~90 MB are uploaded directly (the backend
  converts with its own ffmpeg — no local ffmpeg needed), bigger ones are reduced to
  16 kHz WAV / Opus when a local ffmpeg exists (Jellyfin ships one).
- `run-termux.sh` universal runner prompts once for the URL and saves `config.json`.
- Added `test_addon.py` (config precedence, QR, LAN endpoint, routing, mock-backend
  round trip) — runs in CI alongside the existing suites.

## 1.0.4-pre — (removed) Colab T4 full-movie transcription

> This release's history was removed in 0.2.2-beta. The transcription-only notebook and
> its client belonged to a version whose on-device ML Kit/Vosk stacks were dropped.

## 1.0.3-beta — (removed) speech-to-text update

> Removed with the on-device engine in 0.2.2-beta.
